# Spring 2024 Data Science Case Study

This repository contains some simulated datasets that we will discuss during the interview. We recommend that you spend some time (around 15 to 30 minutes) looking at this data before your interview, but we do not expect any code/analysis/cleaned data. It is so that we can make better use of the interview time.

The interview will consist primarily of a guided discussion of different topics, using this data as a reference. You should feel comfortable to ask any questions you have during the interview. We have also included some pre-interview questions to help you prepare. These are not part of the interview, and you do not need to bring answers.

Please have the data open during the interview so you can reference it easily. You are also welcome to have any notes with you.

## Data

The three datasets are:

* *client_information.csv*
* *crm_data.csv*
* *staffing_reference.csv*

The *crm_data.csv* is the main dataset.

## Pre-interview questions

These questions might help you prepare.

* The structure of the datasets:
  * What are the variables and types?
  * How would you describe the way this data is structured?
  * Is it ready for data analysis?
  * How could you tidy this dataset? (Obs, note the amount of NAs)

* The purpose of this data:
  * How do you think this data is collected of generated?
  * Why do you think this data exists?
  * Why do you think the client asked for our help?

* Data cleaning and analysis:
  * Are there any quality issues with the data?
  * How would you go about validating and fixing this data?
  * What insight could we extract from this data?
  * How could we model or visualise some of the information present here?
