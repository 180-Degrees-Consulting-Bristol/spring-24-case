# Spring 2024 Data Science Case Study

This repository contains some simulated datasets that we will discuss during the interview. We recommend that you spend some time (around 15 to 30 minutes) looking at this data before your interview, but we do not expect any code/analysis/cleaned data. It is so that we can make better use of the interview time.

The interview will consist primarily of a guided discussion of different topics, using this data as a reference. You should feel comfortable to ask any questions you have during the interview.
